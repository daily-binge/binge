There are few shows as brave as the good fight. This is a show that isn't afraid of pissing off whole sections of society. Unabashedly secular? in its rhetoric.

Quotes like - when you're a detective you can do anything, grab them by the pussy, and 'New York's a swamp and I'm cleaning it up, and Trump holding a potbellied pig in the white house. 

Featuring a cast comprising mainly of minorities, in a majority black law firm

A more grown-up version of the good wife. Adrian Boseman saying - 'this is fucked', the brilliant Christine Baranski's Diane Lockhart on mushrooms. Realistic banter between the CDC guy and Marissa Gold.
