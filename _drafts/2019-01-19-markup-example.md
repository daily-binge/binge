Season 2 of the brilliant Belgian TV drama The Break, often described to me as a cross between True detective and Broadchurch, doesn't fail to live up to the expectations set by its initial outing. The setting of the crime this time around is another fictional Wallonian town as bleak as they come. Believe me folks when I tell you this - there are no happy people here. This is no place to bring kids. Hercule Poirot and Tintin are turning in their graves. Yes, Tintin died in this world.
